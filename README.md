# Roblox Horrorlist: A Ranking of Over 260 Roblox Horror Games.
Welcome to the Roblox Horrorlist! This project is dedicated to showcasing almost all the horror games available on Roblox. If you're tired of only finding Mimic clones, you've come to the right place.

## Features:
- **Extensive Collection:** This list contains over **260** Roblox horror games, each carefully reviewed and rated.
- **Ratings:** We rate each game using our `Universal Roblox Horror Game Scale (URHGS-Scale)`. It works by rating the experience from 1 to 10 on the factors *Scariness, Sound Design, Story, Visuals, Ambience, Gameplay, Creativity, Enjoyment, Production Quality, and Technical* and calculating the average.
- **Additional Information:** We also display information such as detailed genres, playtime, etc.

 ## How to Use:
 1. **Explore the List:** Browse the list to discover games that are worth your time, or maybe find comically bad ones.
 2. **Detailed Information:** By hovering over a game with your cursor, information on the game and it's rating will be displayed.

 ## Contribution:
 Currently, we do not support contributing. However, we are working on increasing our team of raters.
